# Streamlit Food Product Classifier

This is a simple Streamlit-based web application that uses machine learning models for food product classification. It allows users to upload an image of a food product, which is then classified into one of several categories using a deep learning model.

## Features
- **Food Image Classification**: Upload food images to classify them into predefined categories.
- **Model**: The model used is a custom CNN trained on food product images, utilizing a `ResNet50` backbone for better accuracy.
- **Prediction with Confidence Scores**: After uploading an image, the model predicts the food category and provides the prediction's confidence score.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **fastai**: For model training and inference, leveraging the `cnn_learner` API.
- **torch**: For deep learning and model architecture.
- **ResNet50**: A pre-trained model used as a backbone for transfer learning.
- **Pillow**: For handling image processing.

## Installation

To run the project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-product-classifier.git
   cd food-product-classifier
